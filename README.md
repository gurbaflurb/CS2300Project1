# Program1 for CS 2300
This program takes reads from two files and builds two matrixes based off of them. Then the program multiplies the first matrix by 5 and subtracts the first matrix by the second matrix. The program then implements a transpose of the first matrix. The program also writes all of these values and matrixes out to files named appropriately. 

## To Build
Use the makefile included to build an executable using the make command. This should build and executable which can be run.
